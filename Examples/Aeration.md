def aeration_data(DO_column, dirpath):
    """This function extracts the data from folder containing tab delimited
    files of aeration data. The file must be the original tab delimited file.
    All text strings below the header must be removed from these files.
    The file names must be the air flow rates with units of micromoles/s.
    An example file name would be "300.xls" where 300 is the flowr ate in
    micromoles/s. The function opens a file dialog for the user to select
    the directory containing the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    DO_column : int
        index of the column that contains the dissolved oxygen concentration
        data.

    dirpath : string
        path to the directory containing aeration data you want to analyze

    Returns
    -------
    filepaths : string list
        all file paths in the directory sorted by flow rate

    airflows : numpy array
        sorted array of air flow rates with units of micromole/s attached

    DO_data : numpy array list
        sorted list of numpy arrays. Thus each of the numpy data arrays can
        have different lengths to accommodate short and long experiments

    time_data : numpy array list
        sorted list of numpy arrays containing the times with units of seconds
